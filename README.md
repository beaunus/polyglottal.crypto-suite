# pretty-sweet-crypto-suite

This project was created while I was a student at Code Chrysalis.

This is a project to show a variety of encryption algorithms throughout history.

My intention is to include a vast amount of algorithms from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cryptography.

## Scripts

```bash
# Get dev tools together
go get github.com/oxequa/realize

# Develop the code with hot reloading
realize start --name="server" --run

# Run all tests [including benchmarks]
go test [-bench .] ./...
```
