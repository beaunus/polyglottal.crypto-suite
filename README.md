# Pretty Sweet Crypto Suite

This project was created while I was a student at [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io/).

This is a project to show a variety of encryption algorithms throughout history.

My intention is to include a vast amount of algorithms from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cryptography.

You can see this project in action at https://pretty-sweet-crypto-suite.herokuapp.com/.
